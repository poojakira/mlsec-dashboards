## Credential and secret handling

- Real API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys, cloud credentials, and populated environment files must never be committed.
- Local users must create their own `.env` from the repository's safe template when environment variables are needed, and must supply **their own** credentials. CI/CD credentials belong in GitHub repository/environment secrets or an external secret manager, not in source or workflow YAML.
- If a real credential is exposed, treat it as compromised even if the commit is quickly deleted. **Revoke or rotate the credential at its provider first.** Then remove it from the current tree, reachable Git history, logs/artifacts, examples, screenshots, and documentation as applicable.
- Rewriting Git history or deleting a file does **not** revoke a credential. Provider-side rotation/revocation is required.
- Placeholder/test credentials must be clearly marked and must not be valid for real services.
